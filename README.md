yarn
yarn start
```
## Basic scripts

Use `yarn run build:dll` for dev builds.

Use `yarn start` for dev server. Default dev port is `3000`.

Use `yarn run start:hmr` to run dev server in HMR mode.

Use `yarn run build` for production build.

Use `yarn run server:prod` for production server and production watch. Default production port is `8088`.

Default ports and option to use proxy backend for dev server can be changed in `constants.js` file.

To create AOT version, run `yarn run build:aot`. This will compile and build script.
Then you can use `yarn run prodserver` to see to serve files.

### Store Logger

Store-logger outputs ngrx actions to the console.
To set your development mode store logging preference, go to the constant.js file and edit the `STORE_DEV_TOOLS` constant.
Available options are `logger | none`

### HMR (Hot Module Replacement)

HMR mode allows you to update a particular module without reloading the entire application.
The current state of your app is also stored in @ngrx/store allowing you to make updates to your
code without losing your currently stored state.

### AOT  Don'ts

The following are some things that will make AOT compile fail.

- Don’t use require statements for your templates or styles, use styleUrls and templateUrls, the angular2-template-loader plugin will change it to require at build time.
- Don’t use default exports.
- Don’t use form.controls.controlName, use form.get(‘controlName’)
- Don’t use control.errors?.someError, use control.hasError(‘someError’)
- Don’t use functions in your providers, routes or declarations, export a function and then reference that function name
- Inputs, Outputs, View or Content Child(ren), Hostbindings, and any field you use from the template or annotate for Angular should be public

### Testing

For unit tests, use `yarn run test` for continuous testing in watch mode and use
`yarn run test:once` for single test. To view code coverage after running test, open `coverage/html/index.html` in your browser.

For e2e tests, use `yarn run e2e`. To run unit test and e2e test at the same time, use `yarn run ci`.
